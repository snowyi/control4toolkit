I'm continiously making small tools and scripts for doing different stuff with control 4 products.

Current avalable:

  * Detect Control 4 Devices on the local network
  * Set of tools to act as a speaker point with a linux/perl/whatever-system

Soon avalable:

  * Tools to set, set and monitor internal and user defined variables in the system, to interact with the programming

Planned:

  * Director Configuration
  * Multiamp-emulator (16 sound streams)
